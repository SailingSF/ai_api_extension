## Background

This is the public repository for all code that runs the [aiartarena.com](https://aiartarena.com) website.

**AI Art Arena** is a user friendly website that puts many of the most cutting edge image models into the hands of non-technical users and gives them several tool to improve image generation.

The free version of the website allows any user to generate one image at a time and leverage free models.

## Running Locally

If you would like to run this website yourself you can clone this repo and `npm install` and `npm run build` to build the website. 

If you would like to use your own Hugging Face API key to create images you should go to the 'user_key' branch where everything runs from a Hugging Face access token in a local .env file. You can even load this as a browser extension to keep everything 100% local. The original idea for this project was a simple browser extension.
